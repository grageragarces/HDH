**Hybrid Dependency Hypergraphs for Quantum Computation**

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This library focuses on translating quantum computations into Hybrid Dependency Hypergraph (HDH) representations for analysis, visualization, and partitioning.

## Project Goals

- Translate quantum computations into HDH format  
  - From popular SDKs (e.g., Qiskit)  
  - From computation classes directly
- Print HDHs in a readable, canonical format  
- Apply embedded partitioning strategies (e.g., METIS, KaHyPar) to analyze computational distribution
