**Model-agnostic tools for Distributed Quantum Computing**

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This project is under active development. It aims to provide compiler infrastructure, intermediate representations, and runtime tooling for distributing quantum circuits across heterogeneous devices.

## Project Goals

- Define a usable IR for distributed quantum computing based on Hybrid Dependency Hypergraphs (HDHs)
- Implement circuit cutting, binning, and scheduling passes
- Provide a backend-agnostic execution pipeline
- Benchmark distribution trade-offs: cost, fidelity, parallelism

## Package Structure

- `hdh/` â€” Core intermediate representation and compiler passes
- `examples/` â€” Example use cases (e.g., Qiskit â†’ HDH â†’ visualization)
- `tests/` â€” Unit tests

## Installation (soon)

```bash
pip install hdh  # Placeholder â€” not published yet
