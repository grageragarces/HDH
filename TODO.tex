DEBUG: 
- motif generation from circuit
- qiskit to hdh translation - not matching hdhs
- delete cutting stuff -- make sure to also delete from README & test

Short term: FIX MEASUREMENT AND HYPEREDGE INTERPRETATION
- make sure hyperedges are considered as hyperedges - not as edges (may be "extra counted")
- fix measurement: measure_all() defo broken, maybe so is measure

Mid term: TRANSLATIONS BACK + PRIMITIVES + TESTS 
- to_qiskit: broken - can't do it for 1 partition + primitives defo not being injected correctly + for >1 partition hdhs not doing great
    -> cut_and_rewrite_hdh
- revise telegate and teledata primitives
- make it possible to inject communication channel noise through telegate and teledata primitive noise injections 
    - for simulations
    - for real implementations?: is this even duable on qiskit?
- actually make tests into real tests

Long term: QMETIS (FM?)     -> cut_and_rewrite_hdh
- recognise nodes form one qubit as a group
- cluster nodes into qubit
- further cluster by weight
- cut
- decluster
- calculate computational cost (added bits and qubits locally via primitives)
